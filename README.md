# React-Native-Application
Used React Native to implement a mobile application. Used a web service to retrieve data for an application.
*****Assignment Requirement*****

Requirements
In this assignment you will create a mobile application with React Native that incorporates a web service.  There is a lot of flexibility to build something you find exciting to create, but your solution must conform to the following minimum requirements:

Create a React Native application with a well-defined purpose and/or target user in-mind.  The exact purpose and/or target user is up to you, but try to find an idea you find fun!

e.g. an application that allows users to access weather report data.

e.g. an application that allows users to access hockey statistics.

e.g. an application that allows users to access Pok√©mon data.

Your application must allow the user to perform actions (e.g. button presses, etc.) that will result in data being retrieved from a web service and being displayed in a neatly formatted way to the user.
You may use multiple web services and/or multiple web service endpoints if you prefer, but only accessing one web service at one endpoint is required.  

At least one parameter must be used when accessing at least one endpoint of the webservice, and this parameter must be different depending on what input the user provides or what actions the user takes.
e.g. a parameter might be set based on what a user has typed into a TextInput
e.g. a parameter might be set based on which button a user has clicked

The application must incorporate a minimum of the following:

At least one List View component

At least one TextInput component

At least two Button components

At least one image

At least one usage of Flexbox to layout the application

The application should be well-designed and professional in appearance.  For full marks the application must exceed the above minimum requirements in some respect in a way that is meaningful to the purpose of the application... either by incorporating different types of React Native components, incorporating more web service endpoints or web services, or in some other way.
